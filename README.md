# SA | Coding Challenge

A list of the most popular repositories of the last week should be displayed and the
user should be able to star them.

The starred repositories should be visible either
through a filter or in a diferent tab. Some basic info about the repo should be
displayed, such as: repo name, link to GitHub, description and number of stars. To keep
things simple, the starring won’t be sent back to GitHub’s servers but just stored in
localStorage.

<b>Bonus task:</b> `If time allows, a language filter would be an awesome addition to have.`

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
